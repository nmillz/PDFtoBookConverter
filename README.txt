This program can take any pdf and convert it into an easy-to-print pdf for making books.

I've included two examples in the files that can be used as a blueprint.
	Alice in Wonderland and its various files shows how formatting and margin placement can work if you would like to make a smaller book using standard 8.5x11" sheets.
	The Story of Rapunzel and its files can be used if you would like to create a more standard size book using 11x17" sheets of paper.

You can also see that there are two "Book" pdf files for Alice in Wonderland. These can show the difference between the option [Will be automatically printing on both sides of sheet?] checked or unchecked.

You can hover over the options to learn about what each one does.
After choosing your options and clicking the [Convert to Book] button, the produced file will be made in the folder where the original pdf was located.
